# Avoid Junk
__Introduction__:
“Avoid junks” is platform game designed on  JAVA platform based game development. It will not be just like as ordinary game, but behind this game is a  very inspirational motive which will help to educate kids about the food and their effects on body. 

__Project Purpose__: 
This project is aim that teaching young children the benefits of healthy food & the disadvantages of junk food through means of a fun game. So, our motive behind to develop this game is “learn with fun”. As a part of the course in dietetics, this is a project we need to make in the form of IEC (information, education, communication) material so that people of a targeted age group (8 to 12) to teach them about benefits of healthy food in the form of a game.

__Project Module__:
Robot: There will be a character or we can say player in game, which will be controlled by the user. Our character can move Left, Right, Duck & Jump.

Friend: Friend will be in the game in types of healthy foods. Player should take the healthy food, and for that, player will get points for it.

Enemy: Enemy will be in the game in types of Junk foods. Player must avoid the junk food, for avoidance there will not be any reward to player, but a gun will be also provided to player, if player shoot out junk food then player will be rewarded. If player collides with the junk food then player will be die and game will be terminated.

Background: There will be background also provided for a game, in which tiles will be there. So if player miss the tile then player will be drop down and die.  

Game Loop: Game loop will be a background process which is responsible for updating the game.

__Game Concepts__:

The player moves for a limited space only, the background moves in opposite direction to create a illusion that the player is moving in forward direction.
Every time interval, the collision of the character is checked with platform, healthy food and junk food. The collision of bullet is compared to junk food.
